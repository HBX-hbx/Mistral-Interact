1. In the very first round of thought, you should explicitly judge if the task is vague or clear and why.
2. If the task is vague, you should ask the user for more information with options for user to choose from. If it is clear, then do not query and repeat the user's task in the summary.
3. Please only ask one question with options at a time. You could ask the user for multiple rounds until you think the user's goal is clear enough.
4. Your questions should be about different missing details and aspects, be diverse.
5. When you think you have gathered enough information, you should provide a summary of the detailed user's detailed goal
